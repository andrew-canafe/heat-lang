# heat-lang
Prototype for a simplistic programming language that I am currently designing. Inspiration was taken from many traditional and modern (OOP) languages, but mostly from C, Go, and Pascal.

## The Language Philosophies (still under construction)
### The simplest solution is often times the best solution
Heat completely removes do-while loops and goto statements, as they are seldom used and are also confusing. Heat replaces switch statements with match statements, which are similar to switch statements except that they do not use break statements inside the body. Heat replaces else-if keyword pairs with a single elif keyword, as it reduces the amount of characters a programmer needs to type. Heat uses a less complex for-loop syntax, similar to the style of the Lua programming language. 

### Coding style shall be stricly enforced by the language
Heat replaces semicolons in favor of newlines, as missing semicolons only result in wasted time during the debugging process. Heat makes it mandatory for the initialization of variables to be explicit, and does not allow zero-by-default initialization.

### Heat gives full power and responsibility to the programmer


### All actions should be explicity defined


### Class inheritance is the root of all evil


### Use different keywords and symbols for different things
